            <h2>Pride and prejudice</h2>

            <div>

                <p class="p">She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. 
                    Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door 
                    with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been
                    gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was 
                    delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly 
                    could not come back.

                    “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the 
                    credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not 
                    aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant 
                    from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:
                    
                    “MY DEAREST LIZZY,--
                    
                    “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting 
                    wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They 
                    insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his 
                    having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter 
                    with me.--Yours, etc.”
                    
                    “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, “if your daughter 
                    should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that 
                    it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”
                    
                    “Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be 
                    taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her 
                    if I could have the carriage.”
                    
                    Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to 
                    be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
                    
                    “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! 
                    You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.”
                    
                    “I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”</p>
